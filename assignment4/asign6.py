# Nidhi's father is not able to calculate his annual tax correctly. He is a bit confused with the taxation rule also each year his total annual income is different. So to help her father Nidhi decides to write a python program that can calculate the tax to be paid based on annual income. Write the same program to calculate the tax to be paid based on annual income. ‚óè Hint: take the annual income as input from the user and print the amount of tax to be paid. These are tax rules.

try:
    annual_income = float(input("Enter your annual income: "))

    if annual_income < 0:
        print("Annual income cannot be negative.")
    else:
        if annual_income <= 250000:
            tax = 0
        elif annual_income <= 500000:
            tax = (annual_income - 250000) * 0.05
        elif annual_income <= 1000000:
            tax = 12500 + (annual_income - 500000) * 0.2
        else:
            tax = 112500 + (annual_income - 1000000) * 0.3

        print("Tax to be paid: ", tax)

except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
