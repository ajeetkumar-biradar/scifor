# Himanshu sells notebooks. Sometimes it becomes a bit difficult for him to calculate the total amount to charge from the customer. To help Himanshu create a program that asks the user to enter the number of books to buy and then print the amount to be paid. ‚óè Hint: Assume the cost of one notebook - $2

cost_per_notebook = 2

num_notebooks = int(input("Enter the number of notebooks to buy: "))

total_amount = num_notebooks * cost_per_notebook

print(f"The total amount to be paid is: ${total_amount}")
